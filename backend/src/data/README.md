# Data

In order to create a new database from scratch:

- ```python create_tables.py ``` - this will create the database.db
- ```python populate_fake_data.py``` - this will populate it with fake data
- ```python qdrant_restaurants.py``` - this will upload the data to the qdrant database setup (remember to have setup a qdrant vector db)
